    "### Building the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a neural network to play chess, one of the fundamental steps is to build a comprehensive dataset that comprises chess board positions and corresponding moves. This dataset can be utilized to train the neural network to predict the optimal move for a given position.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the dataset, one can use a chess engine to produce numerous chess games and document the board positions and moves executed in each game. A Python chess library such as python-chess can help in achieving this objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon acquiring the dataset, the data must be preprocessed to ready it for use in training the neural network. This process may involve converting the board positions into a format that the neural network can interpret, such as a tensor or a flattened vector. Additionally, one-hot encoding can be employed to represent the moves as categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of building a neural network is to establish multiple examples of the independent variable \"x,\" which encodes the board-state, and the dependent outputs \"y_policy\" and \"y_value_head.\" The former suggests the optimal move for the current player, while the latter indicates the present evaluation of the position (-1 for black win, +1 for white win, and any value in between for ongoing games). This evaluation can be thought of as the stockfish eval bar, which is commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook offers different approaches for generating training data that can be used to train a neural network using several techniques."

These records typically include around 100 million games, with almost 6% (for December 2022) of them having been analyzed by Stockfish. The Stockfish evaluation for each move is also appended as a comment on the game's mainlines.

    "### Generating a Dataset for Chess AI Training: Approach 2\n",
    "In this approach, we generate a number of chess positions by randomly sequencing moves and then ask Stockfish for the best move and evaluation for each position. While this method can create a dataset, it has two important drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The chess positions generated from a random sequence of moves may not be representative of positions that naturally arise on the board through regular gameplay.\n",
    "2. The optimal move and evaluation calculations performed by Stockfish can be time-consuming and create a bottleneck in the dataset creation process.\n",
    "Due to these reasons, this method may not be the most effective for creating a dataset for neural network training. However, it can be useful for generating end-game positions, which are typically the weakness of policy head decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate various chess-related tasks using the Stockfish engine, we have provided two functions: stockfish() and stockfish_best_move().\n",
    "\n",
    "The stockfish() function takes a chess board position represented by a chess.Board() object and analyzes it using the Stockfish chess engine to obtain an assessment of the game's score for the current board position, measured in centipawns (100 centipawns ~ 1 pawn). The evaluation score generated by the Stockfish engine ranges from -10000 to +10000 centipawns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function can be called with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "board: a chess.Board() object representing the chess board position.\n",
    "depth: the maximum search depth that the Stockfish engine will use to analyze the board. If None, the engine will analyze the position until a final score is obtained.\n",
    "time_limit: the maximum amount of time in seconds that the Stockfish engine will use to analyze the board. If None, the engine will analyze the position until a final score is obtained. The user can choose to use either depth or time_limit, but not both.\n",
    "The stockfish_best_move() function also takes a chess board position represented by a chess.Board() object and uses the Stockfish engine to find the best move for the current board position. The function can be called with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "board: a chess.Board() object representing the chess board position.\n",
    "time_limit: the maximum amount of time in seconds that the Stockfish engine will use to find the best move for the current board position. The default value is 1.0.\n",

In order to pass this data to the neural netwrok it is somewhat convenient to consolidate this dataset which is split among manydata to a single data file.

It doesnt need to be good but it needs to be able to give this output. This chapter is like a short introduction where the move predictions happen probabilistically from the policy probability distribution that the neural network outputs."
