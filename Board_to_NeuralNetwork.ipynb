    "### Transforming a chess-board to something that a neural network can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this notebook is to transfrom a given chess board to something that a computer can comprehend, such as arrays of real numbers. Since the dimensionality of a chess board is 8x8 , it is apparaent that a lot of the features that the neural network is receiving will be in he form of 8x8 arrays which are frequently mentioned as \"planes\". For example, we can construct many planes, which indicate the position of white and black pieces, E.g. we can have a plane that describes the position of white pawns, another one for black pawns etc. We also include some additional planes in order to create the input dataset ,  which encode information about the pinned pieces of each side, the control of the pieces, castling rights and move turn. Last we also pass a plane which consists of the doubled pawns for the white and black side respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4 Vito\n",
    "However, one needs to be careful to not include too many planes, as this will slow down the training process. In practice, several state-of-the-art neural networks also include the board position, with 14 planes for the positions of pieces, 1 plane for player turn, and 4 planes for castling rights. Additionally those networks also include the previous L board positions (L is integer) , from the last L half-moves."

    "### The neural network policy output\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to think at this point that the nerual network policy output has a categorical output for each available move that could arise in a chess board. Neural networks like alpha zero receive some representation of the chess board (X) and predict 2 outputs (Y1,Y2). The first output is the value head, which returns the probability of winning for each side, which is also known as the evaluation bar. Positive values indicate that white is winning and negative values indicate the opposite. The challenging thing to cope with and understand is the second output (Y2), the policy head. This is the output which calculates a probability for every move to be played in the current position. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After all,depending on the position there are different numbers of possible legal moves. On the other hand we need a constant number of outputs for our network. The general idea to cope with that is to consider every possible starting square and then enumerate all possible moves of a “super-piece” that can move like a queen and a knight and a pawn that promotes. For each of these possible moves we create one output. Naturally there will be outputs that have a positive probability but that correspond to illegal moves. One can cope with that by simply setting these move probabilities to zero and re-compute the remaining probabilities such that their sum equals one."
